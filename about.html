  <h2>About ArchaeoVault</h2>

  <p>
    Before starting this project, our team conducted research and discussions
    about the challenges faced by <strong>Rwandan archaeologists</strong>.
    One of the biggest problems we discovered is the
    <strong>loss of archaeological information</strong>.
    Many discoveries are recorded on paper or stored in unsafe places,
    which can easily be damaged, lost, or forgotten.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, we realized that most <strong>Rwandan citizens</strong>
    do not easily access information about archaeology and artifacts.
    To learn about artifacts, people often need to travel physically
    to museums, which is not always possible for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a solution, our team created <strong>ArchaeoVault</strong> —
    a digital platform designed to help archaeologists
    <strong>safely store their discoveries</strong>
    and help citizens <strong>explore Rwanda’s archaeological heritage online</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this website:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Archaeologists can securely record and manage their discoveries</li>
    <li>Artifacts are linked to the archaeologist who found them</li>
    <li>Photos and videos help preserve evidence</li>
    <li>Citizens can explore archaeological news and discoveries</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="about-vision">
    Our vision is to protect Rwanda’s history,
    educate the younger generation,
    and inspire people to visit archaeological sites and museums.
